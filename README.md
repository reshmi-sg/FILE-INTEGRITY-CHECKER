# As part of my internship with CodTech, I was assigned a task in the Cybersecurity domain to build a File Integrity Checker. 
# This tool helps in ensuring the integrity of important files by detecting any unauthorized modifications, deletions, or corruptions. 
# File integrity is critical in maintaining a secure system, especially when monitoring sensitive configuration files, log files, or application source code.
# In this project, I created a Python script that calculates and stores the cryptographic hash (SHA-256) of each file.
# It later compares the current file hashes with the previously stored ones to identify changes. If any mismatch is detected, it raises an alert that the file may have been tampered with.
# SHA-256 Hashing: Ensures secure hash generation using Python's built-in hashlib library.
# Track File Changes: Detects file additions, deletions, and content modifications.
# Report Generation: Clearly shows which files were altered or are newly added.
# Command-line Interface: Simple and interactive experience for security teams or developers.
# Technologies Used
   Language: Python 3
   Libraries: hashlib, os, json, time
# he tool scans all files in a specified directory.
# It calculates the SHA-256 hash of each file.
# It stores this information in a hashes.json file.
# This project highlights the importance of file integrity monitoring (FIM) in the field of cybersecurity. Attackers often modify system files, scripts, or configurations to install malware or maintain persistence. A file integrity checker is a key component in intrusion detection systems (IDS) and helps organizations stay compliant with security standards such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and ISO 27001.
# I successfully implemented the tool using Python and tested it across multiple scenarios. It deepened my understanding of hashing, file handling, and real-world security practices. This internship task helped me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical cybersecurity implementation.
